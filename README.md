# Country Clustering using K-Means

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to group countries based on shared characteristics such as economic indicators, population, health, or development metrics.
The goal is to uncover patterns or regional groupings that can inform international policy or aid decisions.


## Project Goals

- Segment countries using unsupervised machine learning
- Identify natural groupings in socio-economic or demographic data
- Visualize clusters on a 2D plane
- Explore global patterns through clustering

## Workflow Summary

1. Load country-level dataset  
2. Preprocess and scale features  
3. Use Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters  
4. Apply K-Means Clustering  
5. Visualize clusters and interpret them  


## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib


## Key Results

- Clusters formed: _e.g. 3 distinct groups_  
- Cluster characteristics:  
  - Cluster 0: Developing
  - Cluster 1: Most Develoed
  - Cluster 2: Least Developed



## Skills Demonstrated

- Unsupervised learning  
- K-Means clustering  
- Feature engineering and scaling  
- Elbow method  
- Geo-political pattern analysis  
- Cluster interpretation
